## TroubleShooting

### `vuejs` is not correctly installed

After the npm install, if you use the command `vue -V`, you should get the current VueJS version you're using. If not, scripts are may be disable on your OS. Solution:

 - Open Powershell as administrator
 - run `set-executionpolicy unrestricted`

### `npm run serve` doesn't work

Sometimes, GitHub messes up the name of the folder "`section`". Solution:

 - Change the name of the folder "`Section`" for "`section`"
